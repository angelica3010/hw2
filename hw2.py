#Exercise 3: Numbers and Math
#Complete   the   following   exercises
#a. Find   the   average   of   following   numbers,   assign   it
# to   a   variable,   print   the   average and   total   numbers
#used   for   the   average:
#i. For   Example: #For   numbers  44, 64, 88, 53, 89 when   you   run
#   the   file   it should print something like: The  average  of  5
#   given   numbers   is   : 67.6.
#ii. 39,   45,   55,   90,   95,   96
#iii. 54,   -45,   -10,   90
#iv. 55,65,75,95,32

print("The average of 5 given numbers is :", (44 + 64 + 88 + 53 + 89)/5)

print("The average of 6 given numbers is :", (39 + 45 + 55 + 90 + 95 + 96)/6)

print("The average of 4 given numbers is :", (54 - 45 -10 + 90)/4)

print("The average of 5 given numbers is :", (55 + 65 + 75 + 95 + 32)/5)

#b. Write   a   program   that   tells   if   the   following
#specific   numbers   are   even   or   odd.
#For   example
#1. for   number   4,   your   output   should   be   something   like,
# 4:   is   an   even number
#2. for   number   9,   your   output   should   be   something   like,
#9   is   an   odd number.
#ii. 9
#iii. 19
#iv. 20

print("4 is an even number", (4 % 2 == 0))
print("9 is an odd number", (9 % 2 != 0))
print("19 is an odd number", (19 % 2 !=0 ))
print("20 is an even number", (20 % 2 == 0))
